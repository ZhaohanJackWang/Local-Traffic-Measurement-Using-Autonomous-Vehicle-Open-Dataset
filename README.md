# Conducting Local Traffic Flow Measurements Based on Autonomous Vehicles Data

This repository contains the codes to conduct local traffic flow measurements using LiDAR data from the Waymo Open Dataset. Traffic flow calculations and visualizations were performed using two separate Jupyter Notebooks and the methodology is explained in the honours thesis. This thesis has been submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Civil Engineering (Honours) at University of New South Wales. 

## Dataset
The dataset used was obtained from [Waymo Open Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/download/). 

## Environment
The environment used to perform the tasks are:
- Python 3.8.1
- Tensorflow 2.6.0
